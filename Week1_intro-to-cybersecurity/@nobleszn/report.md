In early 2025, Wema Bank was involved in a cyber fraud and data breach scandal worth about

external parties to divert large sums of money and manipulate sensitive customer data.

The victims included Wema Bank’s customers whose data was compromised, the bank itself
(financially and reputationally), its shareholders, and broader investor confidence in the Nigerian
banking sector.

 Stronger internal controls and segregation of duties to prevent collusion among staff.

manipulated or accessed improperly.
