# CYBER ATTACK
## Columbus City Government.
### What happened?
The City of Columbus, Ohio, suffered a ransomware attack on July 18, 2024, attributed to the Rhysida 
ransomware gang. The attackers attempted to disrupt the city's IT infrastructure, possibly to deploy 
ransomware and solicit a ransom payment. Fortunately, the city's Department of Technology quickly 
identified the threat and took action to significantly limit potential exposure by severing internet 
connectivity. Despite the city's claims that no systems were encrypted, the Rhysida gang claimed 
responsibility and alleged they stole 6.5 TB of sensitive data.

### Who was affected?
Approximately 500,000 individuals were affected, with their personal and financial information 
compromised. The stolen data included employee credentials, city video camera feeds, server dumps, 
and other sensitive information. The Rhysida gang published 45% of the stolen data (around 3.1 TB) on 
their dark web leak site.

### How could it have been prevented?
To prevent similar attacks, cities can implement:
- Multi-factor authentication: Adding an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access
- Regular system updates and patches: Fixing vulnerabilities before they're exploited
- Employee training on phishing and cybersecurity: Educating staff to recognize potential threats
- Data backups and disaster recovery plans: Ensuring business continuity in case of an attack
In response to the attack, the City of Columbus :
- Notified 500,000 individuals about the breach and provided 24 months of free Experian IdentityWorks 
credit monitoring and identity restoration services
- Filed a lawsuit against a cybersecurity researcher, David Leroy Ross, for allegedly spreading stolen data
- Worked with law enforcement and external cybersecurity experts to investigate and mitigate the 
breach
The incident highlights the importance of robust cybersecurity measures and transparent 
communication during and after such events
